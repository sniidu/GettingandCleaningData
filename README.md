# Instructions for run_analysis.R script

How to proceed:

 * Start by setting your working directory in R
 * Files to be extracted to working directory can be downloaded from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
 
Even though I have added some instructions into the script, I'll go that step by step here for the remainder:

 * Step 1: Reading files into the working space from working directory, combining train and test datasets and extracting names from variables
 
 * Step 2: Getting rid of unnecessary variables using grep function
 
 * Steps 3 and 4: Modifying names of variables and merging the final untidy data

 * Step 5: Creating tidy dataset using aggregate and merge functions and exporting dataset into tidyData.txt file
 
 Have a blast!
